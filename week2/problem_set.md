# Week 2 problem set

Here is the workflow students may want to go through:

+ use Numpy to simulate a directed, weighted network containing 1,000 nodes;
+ create a visual representation of the network with the following
+ characteristics:
  * layout is 'Spring Layout' (ignore the technicalities of the algorithm, which
      will be discussed in the second part of the module);
  * edges are color-coded to reflect the intensity of the relation between v and
      u (whatever the relationship means);
  * the size of nodes is proportional to the sum of the weights of 
      the edges that point to each individual node.

Tips: in order to simulate network, you may want to screen for functions
included in the numpy.random module; play a little bit with the different
color-maps offered by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html)

Deliverables: by Wednesday (8:00 PM), individual students submit their Jupyter
notebook and copy of the visualization (.pdf format).
