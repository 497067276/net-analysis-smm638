# net-analysis-smm638

Module Overview
===============

Networks are ubiquitous: job offerings reach us via inter-personal
connections; what we see on the screen of our digital device is a
function of the relationships we develop in the digital world; market
valuations are―largely―the byproduct of social influence, which
accumulates and spreads over relations. This module provides students
with cutting-edge network theories and practical tools to appreciate the
organization and functioning of disparate networks. Ultimately, the goal
is to develop a distinctive angle on how networks bring value to
individuals, organizations, and communities.

Materials & Readings
====================

For this module, students are not required to purchase any (expensive)
book, whereas it is essential they carefully go through the following:

-   lecture notes (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638)
    weekly);

-   selected chapters from [Networks, Crowds,
    Markets](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/)
    (access via our Library websiste)

-   selected chapters from [Network
    Science](http://networksciencebook.com/) (access via the Book
    website)

Discretionary readings students may want to reference to:

-   How networks matter:
    [Linked](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Social-Network-Analysis-Applications-Structural/dp/0521387078)

-   Mathematical foundations of network analytics: [Introduction to
    Graph
    Theory](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486678709/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538502346&sr=1-1&keywords=graph+theory)

-   Social network analysis metrics: [Social Network Analysis: Methods
    and
    Applications](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Social-Network-Analysis-Applications-Structural/dp/0521387078)

-   Journal articles (to be uploaded onto
    Moodle/[Github](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/net-analysis-smm638)
    weekly)

Learning Objectives and Assessment
==================================

At the end of the module, students should be able:

-   to appreciate the properties of networks;

-   to appreciate the properties of communities of nodes belonging to a
    network;

-   to appreciate the properties of individual nodes belonging to a
    network;

-   to visually represent the key features of networks;

-   to leverage the most advanced Python modules for network analytics;

-   to mobilize key network analytics notions and tools in order to
    produce elegant, effective, and efficient solutions to practical
    problems in the field of business strategy, product innovation, and
    operations.

As per the module specification, students will be assessed on the basis
of coursework submissions, which all are the outcome of group-level
efforts (yes, you understand correctly, for this module there is no
final examination and you are not supposed to deliver any assignment on
your own). Specifically, there are two pieces of coursework, namely a
'mid-term project' (MTP), and a 'final course project' (FCP), which
contribute to the final mark (FM) as follows:

FM = 0.25 X MTP + 0.75 X FCP

For the **mid-term project**, students are required to solve a network
analytic problem. This year, the project will focus on the topic of
'core-periphery' (details will be available by week 3, when the project
will be released). Submissions will be assessed on a 0 - 100% scale.
The Groups who fail can resubmit a revised version of the project; if
the revision is sufficient, students receive a 50% mark. The deadline
for the project is November 12 (week 6). Selected groups will be invite
to present the outcome of their work to fellow students in week 6.

With the **final course project** (due by week 10, see Table 1), groups
make their hands 'dirty' as they help a real-world client to face some
network analytic challenges. Details about the client and the challenge
will be available in week 8. Final course projects will be evaluated on
a rolling-based window and should be submitted by December 20.

Both types of assessment will be evaluated along four criteria: i)
appropriate use of notions and frameworks discussed in class; ii)
effectiveness of the proposed answer or solution; iii)
originality/creativity of the proposed answer or solution; iv)
organization an clarity of submitted materials. All criteria carry-out
equal weight in terms of mark.

**Problem sets** will be launched weekly. Students may want to deal
these problem sets and present their solution to the class. One student
per session will be selected on the basis of the novelty and
effectiveness of the proposed solution. One bonus point
(+1 FM) will be assigned.

Schedule of the Module
======================

Prerequisites
=============

The SMM692 ― Python Pre-Course module defines the knowledge students
should possess in order to proficiently attend to SMM638 -- Network
Analytics.

Software Requirements
=====================

For this module you are supposed to run Python 3.6 on your machine. Now,
how to get Python work on your machine? There are several ways to do
that. A fast, smooth alternative is to install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), an open source
distribution of Python that includes: i) 250+ popular data science
packages; ii) the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) package,
which makes quick and easy to install, run, and upgrade complex data
science and machine learning environments.

Here is the workflow:

1.  Use your preferred browser to open the link pointing to the
    [Anaconda repository](http://www.numpy.org/);

2.  Select the installer the which suits your machine (32- or 64-bit)
    and operating system (Win, Mac OS, Linux). Mac users may want to
    download the graphical installer rather than the command-line
    installer (students may feel less comfortable with);

3.  Retrieve the installer (perhaps in your download folder);

4.  Run the installer;

5.  Log-out from your current session (it does not matter if you use
    Win, Mac OS or Linux);

6.  Log-in into a new session;

7.  Run 'Anaconda Navigator'―namely, a convenient place to launch the
    IPython shell or other user-interfaces to interact with IPython.

On top of Anaconda ― Python, students should install the module
[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) (I recommend to do that using
Conda), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and
[Graph-Tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/).
